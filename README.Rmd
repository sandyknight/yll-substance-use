## Required packages

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(janitor)
library(openxlsx)
library(stringr)
library(arrow)
library(tidyr)
library(glue)
library(scales)
```

## Set-up

Two of the datasets used in the analysis aren't publicly available, so I've not uploaded the `data `directory here. To get the analysis working you'll have to add the two original data files with this structure:
```
├── data
│   └── raw
│       ├── post election data for Jon- sent.xlsx
│       └── table1_all deaths_Cocaine version 1.xlsx
```

I've included the session info with R and package versions at the end to help with any compatability issues.

## Getting the data

Each of these functions take no arguments and return a raw dataset when called.

### Drug poisoning data

The ONS publishes drug poisonings and classifies them as "related to drug misuse" given certain criteria i.e. specific ICD-10 codes on the death record. 

The linkage of NDTMS and ONS data reveals that some deaths that had insufficient information for the ONS to apply this classification are probably related to drug misuse since they occured either in treatment or within a year of discharge. This analysis uses data from both sources to adjust the total number of deaths to include these additional deaths.

The functions in this section load each of the raw datasets when called.

### NDTMS-ONS linked dataset deaths

Drug poisoning deaths from the NDTMS-ONS data linkage. This function loads the required data from an Excel workbook received by email from EAT with the name `table1_all deaths_Cocaine version 1.xlsx`. Since loading data this large from Excel takes a long time it is saved as a parquet file to speed up later analysis. If this is already done the function does nothing. Note that this is not publicly available data.  

```{r function-get_drug_deaths}
get_drug_poisoning_deaths <- function(){ 
if (!file.exists("data/raw/ndtms_mortality_data.parquet")) {
  #  This file is NDTMS-ONS data linkage; received by email from Stefan and
  #  named: "table1_all deaths_Cocaine version 1.xlsx"
  
  df <- # Load deaths data from Excel
    openxlsx::read.xlsx("data/raw/table1_all deaths_Cocaine version 1.xlsx",
                        sheet = "table1_all deaths")
  # Write data to easier format
  write_parquet(df, "data/raw/ndtms_mortality_data.parquet")
  
}
  # Return raw data
  read_parquet("data/raw/ndtms_mortality_data.parquet")

}
```

### ONS deaths related to drug poisoning

The ONS drug poisoning data is publicly available at the URI in this function. This function downloads, reshapes, and returns the relevant ONS data.

```{r function-get_ons_drug_poisoning_data} 
get_ons_drug_poisoning_data  <- 
function(){
url <- "https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/deathsrelatedtodrugpoisoningenglandandwalesreferencetable/current/2023registrations.xlsx"

ons_registrations <-
  openxlsx::read.xlsx(
    url,
    sheet = "Table 1",
    startRow = 4,
    sep.names = "_",
    fillMergedCells = TRUE,
    skipEmptyCols = TRUE,
    check.names = TRUE
  ) |> 
  select(1,2,5,9)

colnames(ons_registrations) <- c("sex", "year", "all_drug_poisoning", "drug_misuse")

ons_registrations <- 
ons_registrations |> 
  slice(3:100) |> 
  mutate(sex = zoo::na.locf(sex)) |> 
  filter(sex == "Persons") |> 
  as_tibble() |> 
  filter(!is.na(year))

return(ons_registrations)
}
```

### Non-poisoning deaths of people with contact with the treatment system

The NDTMS-ONS data linkage also has records for people who died in treatment or after treatment from causes other than drug poisoning. This analysis adds those deaths to either drug- or -alcohol related deaths depending on the cause and, in the case of those people in treatment for drug use, time since discharge. 

The treatment mortality data was received by email from EAT,(*received: 2024-07-08 from CA*) and named `post election data for Jon- sent.xlsx`. This data is not publicly available.

```{r, function-get_non_poisoning_deaths}

get_non_poisoning_deaths <- function(){
np_deaths <- 
  openxlsx::read.xlsx("data/raw/post election data for Jon- sent.xlsx", sheet = "NDTMS_ONS") |> 
  janitor::clean_names()

np_deaths <- 
np_deaths |> 
  filter(geography == "LA")

return(np_deaths )
  
}
```

### ONS alcohol-specific deaths

The ONS alcohol-specific death data is publicly available at the URI in this function. This function downloads, reshapes, and returns the relevant ONS data.

```{r function-get_ons_alcohol_specific_death_data}
get_ons_alcohol_specific_death_data <- 
  function(){
    
url <- 
  "https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/causesofdeath/datasets/alcoholspecificdeathsbysexagegroupandindividualcauseofdeath/current/deathsbyindividualcause.xlsx"

alc_specific_deaths <- 
read.xlsx(
  xlsxFile = url, rows = c(5:50), cols = c(1:24),colNames = TRUE, sheet = "Table 2") %>% 
  rename_with(.fn = janitor::make_clean_names, .cols = 1:4)  |> 
  rename("period" = year_note_3) %>% 
  filter(sex != "Persons") |> 
  tidyr::pivot_longer(cols = `<1`:`90+`, names_to = "age_group", values_to = "count") |> 
  group_by(sex, age_group) |> 
  summarise(count = sum(count), .groups = "drop")
 
return(alc_specific_deaths)
}
```

### Life expectancy

This function downloads, re-labels, and reshapes the ONS life tables for use in the YLL analysis. 

```{r function-get_life_tables}
get_life_tables <- function() {
    url <- "https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/lifeexpectancies/datasets/nationallifetablesunitedkingdomreferencetables/current/nltuk198020203.xlsx"
    
    life_tables <- 
        read.xlsx(
        xlsxFile = url,
        sheet = "2020-2022",
        startRow = 6
      ) |>
        rename_with(.cols = 1:6, ~paste0(.x, "_male")) |>
        rename_with(.cols = 7:12, ~paste0(.x, "_female")) |>
        select(ex_male, age_female, ex_female) |>
        pivot_longer(cols = contains("ex"), values_to = "ex", names_to = "sex") |>
        mutate(sex = str_remove(sex, "ex_")) |> 
        rename("age" = age_female)
    
    return(life_tables)
}

```

## Data processing and preparation

### Drug deaths

The following two functions were written to allow other analyses of drug deaths and have more flexibilty (and therefore are unfortunately long and complicated) than is necessary for the YLL analysis. They should both take the output of the corresponding `get_*_data()` functions as the `data` argument. For this analysis we'll choose to group the data by age and sex, and use date of occurrence rater than registration. 

```{r function-process_drug_poisoning_deaths}

#' Process drug poisoning data
#' 
#' Reads, cleans, and processes drug poisoning data from a file. Filters and groups the data 
#' based on user-defined parameters, such as years, date type, and grouping.

#' @param date_of Either "occurrence" (year of death) or "registration" (year of registration).
#' @param years Vector of years to include in the analysis.

```

### Alcohol deaths

This function extracts:    
1. alcohol-specific deaths in or after treatment and;
2. deaths of people in treatment for alcohol use only
from the output of `get_non_poisoning_deaths()`

```{r}

get_alcohol_specific_deaths_from_tx <- function(data){
data |> 
  filter(drug_group == "alcohol only"|death_cause == "Alcohol-specific death") |> 
  filter(treatment_status != "Died one or more years following discharge")
  
}

```

### Age group parsing

These functions parse the age groups in the datasets that don't have single-year-of-age fields to allow merging.

```{r function-parse_age_groups}
# Simplified parse_age_groups function
parse_age_groups <- function(age_groups) {
  # Patterns for age group formats
  pattern_range <- "^([0-9]+)-([0-9]+)$"
  pattern_under <- "^<([0-9]+)$"
  pattern_over  <- "^([0-9]+)\\+$"
  
  # Initialize vectors
  lower <- rep(NA_real_, length(age_groups))
  upper <- rep(NA_real_, length(age_groups))
  
  # Identify which pattern each age group matches
  is_range <- grepl(pattern_range, age_groups)
  is_under <- grepl(pattern_under, age_groups)
  is_over  <- grepl(pattern_over, age_groups)
  
  # For range: extract lower and upper numbers 
  if (any(is_range)) {
    lower[is_range] <- as.numeric(sub(pattern_range, "\\1", age_groups[is_range]))
    upper[is_range] <- as.numeric(sub(pattern_range, "\\2", age_groups[is_range])) 
  }
  
  # For under: "<X" means lower = -Inf, upper = X
  if (any(is_under)) {
    upper[is_under] <- as.numeric(sub(pattern_under, "\\1", age_groups[is_under]))
    lower[is_under] <- -Inf
  }
  
  # For over: "X+" means lower = X, upper = Inf
  if (any(is_over)) {
    lower[is_over] <- as.numeric(sub(pattern_over, "\\1", age_groups[is_over]))
    upper[is_over] <- Inf
  }
  
  # Create and return a data frame
  data.frame(
    age_group = age_groups,
    lower = lower,
    upper = upper,
    stringsAsFactors = FALSE
  )
}


```

```{r function-assign_age_group}
# Simplified assign_age_group function
assign_age_group <- function(ages, age_df) {
  # We assume ages is already an integer vector
  age_groups <- character(length(ages))
  
  # Assign age groups based on intervals
  for (i in seq_len(nrow(age_df))) {
    in_interval <- ages >= age_df$lower[i] & ages <= age_df$upper[i]
    age_groups[in_interval] <- age_df$age_group[i]
  }
  
  return(age_groups)
}

## Calculating years of life lost (YLL)

This function calculates the "crude" years of life lost. 

The crude expected years of life lost is:

$$
YLL = (D_{x})(e_{x}^s)
$$

Where $D_x$ is the number of deaths in the age group and $e_{x}^s$ is the mean standard age of death from the external life expectancy (the ONS life tables) for the age. This is the method used by the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) [^1].   

```{r function-calculate_crude_yll}
calculate_crude_yll <- function() {
  # Step 1: Merge alcohol-related deaths into a single dataset
  alcohol_deaths <- merge_alcohol_deaths()
  
  # Step 2: Parse the age groups in the alcohol deaths data to get lower and upper bounds
  age_df <- parse_age_groups(pull(alcohol_deaths, age_group))
  
  # Step 3: Retrieve life tables, which contain life expectancy (ex) by sex and age
  life_tables <- get_life_tables()
  
  # Step 4: Calculate years of life lost (YLL) for alcohol-related deaths
  yll_alcohol <- 
    life_tables |> 
    # Assign each age in life tables to an age group based on parsed age group bounds
    mutate(age_group = assign_age_group(ages = age, age_df)) |> 
    # Group by sex and age group and calculate the average life expectancy (ex)
    group_by(sex, age_group) |> 
    summarise(ex = mean(ex), .groups = "drop") |> 
    # Merge with alcohol deaths data to match life expectancy with death counts
    right_join(alcohol_deaths, by = c("sex", "age_group")) |> 
    # Calculate YLL by multiplying life expectancy (ex) with the number of deaths (count)
    mutate(yll = ex * count) 
  
  # Step 5: Summarise alcohol-related YLL and death counts by age group and substance
  yll_alcohol <- 
    yll_alcohol |> 
    group_by(age_group, substance) |> 
    summarise(count = sum(count), yll = sum(yll), .groups = "drop")
  
  # Step 6: Merge drug-related deaths into a single dataset
  drug_deaths <- merge_drug_deaths()
  
  # Step 7: Calculate YLL for drug-related deaths
  yll_drugs <- 
    left_join(
      drug_deaths,  # Join drug deaths data
      life_tables,  # With life tables to get life expectancy (ex) by sex and age
      by = c("sex", "age")
    ) |> 
    # Calculate YLL by multiplying life expectancy (ex) with the number of deaths (count)
    mutate(yll = count * ex)
  
  # Step 8: Re-parse the age groups in the summarised alcohol YLL data

This function is from [here](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1186%2F1471-2458-8-116/MediaObjects/12889_2007_1086_MOESM3_ESM.pdf)[^2]. It uses the same basic method but applies discounting and age-weighting according to parameters calibrated and chosen in the GBD. 

The formula is:

$$
Y_x = d_x \left[ \frac{KCe^{r(n^a_x)}}{(r+\beta)^2} \left( e^{z[-(r+\beta)(e^s_x + a_x) - 1]} - e^{-(r+\beta)a_x[-(r+\beta)a_x - 1]} \right) + \frac{1-K}{r} (1 - e^{r(e^s_x)}) \right]
$$
where:
𝑎 = age of death (years)
𝑟 = discount rate (usually 3%)
𝛽 = age weighting constant (usually 𝛽=0.04)
𝐾 = age-weighting modulation constant (usually 𝐾=1)
𝐶 = adjustment constant for age-weights (usually 𝐶=0.1658)
𝑒 = standard life expectancy at age of death (years)


```{r function-calculate_yll}

calculate_yll <-
  function(number.deaths,
           average.age.death,
           model.life.expectancy,
           discount.rate = 0.03,
           beta.constant = 0.04,
           modulation.constant = 0,
           adjustment.constant = 0.1658) {
    ## abbreviate inputs
    N <- number.deaths
    a <- average.age.death
    L <- model.life.expectancy
    r <- discount.rate
    b <- beta.constant
    K <- modulation.constant
    CC <- adjustment.constant
    ## do calculations
    if (discount.rate == 0) {
      N * (K * CC * ((exp(-b * a)) / b^2) * ((exp(-b * L)) * (-b * (L + a) - 1) - (-b * a - 1)) + ((1 - K) * L))
    } else {
      N * (K * ((CC * exp(r * a)) / (-(r + b)^2)) * ((exp(-(r + b) * (L + a)) * (-(r + b) * (L + a) - 1)) - (exp(-(r + b) * a) * (-(r + b) * a - 1))) + ((1 - K) / r) * ((1 - exp(-r * L))))
    }
  }

```

This function uses the `calculate_yll` function to estimate the total YLL for drug and alcohol use with discounting and age weighting. 

```{r function-calculate_substance_use_yll}
calculate_substance_use_yll <- function() {
  # Merge and summarise alcohol-related deaths by age group and sex
  alcohol_deaths <- 
    merge_alcohol_deaths()

  # Create a data frame mapping age values to defined age groups, derived from alcohol_deaths
  age_df <- 
    parse_age_groups(unique(pull(alcohol_deaths, age_group)))

  # Load life tables
  life_tables <- 
    get_life_tables()
  # Incorporate age groups into life tables, then compute average age and life expectancy (ex) for each age group and sex
  life_tables <-
    life_tables |>
    mutate(age_group = assign_age_group(ages = pull(life_tables, age), age_df = age_df)) |>
    group_by(sex, age_group) |>
    summarise(mean_age = mean(age), ex = mean(ex), .groups = "drop")

  # Join alcohol deaths with the relevant life table data to calculate Years of Life Lost (YLL)
  alcohol_yll <-
    left_join(alcohol_deaths, life_tables) |>
    mutate(yll = calculate_yll(number.deaths = count, average.age.death = mean_age, model.life.expectancy = ex)) |>
    group_by(age_group, substance) |>
    summarise(count = sum(count), yll = sum(yll), .groups = "drop")

  # Merge and summarise drug-related deaths by age and sex
  drug_deaths <- merge_drug_deaths()

  # Get ONS life tables for drugs YLL calculation
  life_tables <- get_life_tables()

  # Join drug deaths data with life table data
  yll <-
    left_join(drug_deaths, life_tables)

  # Calculate YLL for drug-related deaths
  drugs_yll <-
    yll |>
    mutate(yll = calculate_yll(number.deaths = count, average.age.death = age, model.life.expectancy = ex))

  # Assign drug deaths to appropriate age groups using age_df generated above
  drugs_yll <-
    drugs_yll |>
    mutate(age_group = assign_age_group(ages = age, age_df)) |>
    group_by(age_group, substance) |>
    summarise(count = sum(count), yll = sum(yll), .groups = "drop")

  # Combine YLL estimates for both alcohol and drugs into one dataset
  substance_use_yll <- bind_rows(alcohol_yll, drugs_yll)

  # Return the final data frame containing combined YLL estimates for both alcohol and drug substances
  return(substance_use_yll)
}

## Plotting results

### Plot crude estimate

Produces a plot of the crude YLL estimate. Sources two scripts that define `ggplot2` aesthetics but don't contibute to the analysis.

```{r function-plot_crude_yll_estimate}
plot_crude_yll_estimate <- 
  function(){
source("R/dhsc_colour_palette.R")
source("R/themes.R")
crude_yll <-
  calculate_crude_yll()

p <- 
crude_yll  |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = age_group, y = yll)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = substance), colour = "black") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(
    title = "Estimated years of life lost (YLL), due to substance use",
    subtitle = glue::glue("Total YLL: {scales::comma(sum(crude_yll$yll))} (without discounting or age weighting)"),
    caption = "Data from ONS and NDTMS for deaths which occurred in 2022",
    fill = NULL,
    x = "Age group",
    y = "YLL"
       ) +
  my_theme + my_fill_scale +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, vjust = 0.5),
    legend.direction = "horizontal",
    plot.caption = element_text(face = "italic")
      )
  
return(p)
  }

plot_crude_yll_estimate()

```


### Plot discounted and weighted estimate

Produces a similar plot for the discounted and age-weighted YLL estimate

```{r function-plot_substance_use_yll_estimate}
plot_substance_use_yll_estimate <-
  function(){
    source("R/dhsc_colour_palette.R")
    source("R/themes.R")
    
    yll <-
      calculate_substance_use_yll()
    
    yll |>
      ggplot(aes(x = age_group, y = yll)) +
      geom_col(aes(fill = substance), colour = "black") +
      scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
      labs(
        title = "Estimated years of life lost (YLL), due to substance use",
        subtitle = glue::glue(
          "Total YLL: {scales::comma(sum(yll$yll))} (with discounting and age weighting)"
        ),
        caption = "Data from ONS and NDTMS for deaths which occurred in 2022",
        fill = NULL,
        x = "Age group",
        y = "YLL"
      ) +
      my_theme + my_fill_scale +
      theme(
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, vjust = 0.5),
        legend.direction = "horizontal",
        plot.caption = element_text(face = "italic")
      )
